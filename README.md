# Randomly-Generated-Math-Game
This project is made entirely in native Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap. It generates an equation with three operands, two operators, and one set of parentheses. All numbers are positive whole numbers and the answer is always between 0-9. The user will  be able to input this on a keyboard or select from a number pad.
